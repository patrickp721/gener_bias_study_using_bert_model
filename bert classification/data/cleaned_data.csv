"<p>in the past the prevailing idea has been well expressed in the saying that ""captains of industry are born, not made"" and the theory has been that if one could get the right man, methods could be safely left to him. in the future it will be appreciated that our leaders must be trained right as well as born right, and that no great man can (with the old system of personal management) hope to compete with a number of ordinary men who have been properly organized so as efficiently to cooperate. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>this paper was originally prepared for presentation to the american society of mechanical engineers. the illustrations chosen are such as, it is believed, will especially appeal to engineers and to managers of industrial and manufacturing establishments, and also quite as much to all of the men who are working in these establishments. it is hoped, however, that it will be clear to other readers that the same principles can be applied with equal force to all social activities: to the management of our homes; the management of our farms; the management of the business of our tradesmen, large and small; of our churches, our philanthropic institutions, our universities, and our governmental departments. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>in the same way maximum prosperity for each employee means not only higher wages than are usually received by men of his class, but, of more importance still, it also means the development of each man to his state of maximum efficiency, so that he may be able to do, generally speaking, the highest grade of work for which his natural abilities fit him, and it further means giving him, when possible, this class of work to do. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the majority of these men believe that the fundamental interests of employees and employers are necessarily antagonistic scientific management, on the contrary, has for its very foundation the firm conviction that the true interests of the two are one and the same; that prosperity for the employer cannot exist through a long term of years unless it is accompanied by prosperity for the employee, and vice versa; and that it is possible to give the workman what he most wants high wages and the employer what he wants a low labor cost -- for his manufactures. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>it is hoped that some at least of those who do not sympathize with each of these objects may be led to modify their views; that some employers, whose attitude toward their workmen has been that of trying to get the largest amount of work out of them for the smallest possible wages, may be led to see that a more liberal policy toward their men will pay them better; and that some of those workmen who begrudge a fair and even a large profit to their employers, and who feel that all of the fruits of their labor should belong to them, and that those for whom they work and the capital invested in the business are entitled to little or nothing, may be led to modify these views. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the truth of this fact is also perfectly clear in the case of two men working together. to illustrate: if you and your workman have become so skilful that you and he together are making two pairs of shoes in a day, while your competitor and his workman are making only one pair, it is clear that after selling your two pairs of shoes you can pay your workman much higher wages than your competitor who produces only one pair of shoes is able to pay his man, and that there will still be enough money left over for you to have a larger profit than your competitor. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>in the case of a more complicated manufacturing establishment, it should also be perfectly clear that the greatest permanent prosperity for the workman, coupled with the greatest prosperity for the employer, can be brought about only when the work of the establishment is done with the smallest combined expenditure of human effort, plus nature's resources, plus the cost for the use of capital in the shape of machines, buildings, etc. or, to state the same thing in a different way: that the greatest prosperity can exist only as the result of the greatest possible productivity of the men and machines of the establishment that is, when each man and each machine are turning out the largest possible output; because unless your men and your machines are daily turning out more work than others around you, it is clear that competition will prevent your paying higher wages to your workmen than are paid to those of your competitor. and what is true as to the possibility of paying high wages in the case of two companies competing close beside one another is also true as to whole districts of the country and even as to nations which are in competition. in a word, that maximum prosperity can exist only as the result of maximum productivity. later in this paper illustrations will be given of several companies which are earning large dividends and at the same time paying from 30 per cent to 100 per cent higher wages to their men than are paid to similar men immediately around them, and with whose employers they are in competition. these illustrations will cover different types of work, from the most elementary to the most complicated. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>if the above reasoning is correct, it follows that the most important object of both the workmen and the management should be the training and development of each individual in the establishment, so that he can do (at his fastest pace and with the maximum of efficiency) the highest class of work for which his natural abilities fit him. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>when the same workman returns to work on the following day, instead of using every effort to turn out the largest possible amount of work, in a majority of the cases this man deliberately plans to do as little as he safely can -- to turn out far less work than he is well able to do -- in many instances to do not more than one-third to one-half of a proper day's work. and in fact if he were to do his best to turn out his largest possible day's work, he would be abused by his fellow-workers for so doing, even more than if he had proved himself a ""quitter"" in sport. under working, that is, deliberately working slowly so as to avoid doing a full day's work, ""soldiering,"" as it is called in this country, ""hanging it out,"" as it is called in england, ""ca' cannie,"" as it is called in scotland, is almost universal in industrial establishments, and prevails also to a large extent in the building trades; and the writer asserts without fear of contradiction that this constitutes the greatest evil with which the working-people of both england and america are now afflicted. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>it will be shown later in this paper that doing away with slow working and ""soldiering"" in all its forms and so arranging the relations between employer and employee that each workman will work to his very best advantage and at his best speed, accompanied by the intimate cooperation with the management and the help (which the workman should receive) from the management, would result on the average in nearly doubling the output of each man and each machine. what other reforms, among those which are being discussed by these two nations, could do as much toward promoting prosperity, toward the diminution of poverty, and the alleviation of suffering? america and england have been recently agitated over such subjects as the tariff, the control of the large corporations on the one hand, and of hereditary power on the other hand, and over various more or less socialistic proposals for taxation, etc. on these subjects both peoples have been profoundly stirred, and yet hardly a voice has been raised to call attention to this vastly greater and more important subject of ""soldiering,"" which directly and powerfully affects the wages, the prosperity, and the life of almost every working-man, and also quite as much the prosperity of every industrial establishment in the nation. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>why is it, then, in the face of the self-evident fact that maximum prosperity can exist only as the result of the determined effort of each workman to turn out each day his largest possible day's work, that the great majority of our men are deliberately doing just the opposite, and that even when the men have the best of intentions their work is in most cases far from efficient? </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<i><p>first</i>. the fallacy, which has from time immemorial been almost universal among workmen, that a material increase in the output of each man or each machine in the trade would result in the end in throwing a large number of men out of work. </p>",man,['work']
"<i><p>second</i>. the defective systems of management which are in common use, and which make it necessary for each workman to soldier, or work slowly, in order that he may protect his own best interests. </p>",man,['work']
"<i><p>first</i>. the great majority of workmen still believe that if they were to work at their best speed they would be doing a great injustice to the whole trade by throwing a lot of men out of work, and yet the history of the development of each trade shows that each improvement, whether it be the invention of a new machine or the introduction of a better method, which results in increasing the productive capacity of the men in the trade and cheapening the costs, instead of throwing men out of work make in the end work for more men. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the cheapening of any article in common use almost immediately results in a largely increased demand for that article. take the case of shoes, for instance. the introduction of machinery for doing every element of the work which was formerly done by hand has resulted in making shoes at a fraction of their former labor cost, and in selling them so cheap that now almost every man, woman, and child in the working-classes buys one or two pairs of shoes per year, and wears shoes all the time, whereas formerly each workman bought perhaps one pair of shoes every five years, and went barefoot most of the time, wearing shoes only as a luxury or as a matter of the sternest necessity. in spite of the enormously increased output of shoes per workman, which has come with shoe machinery, the demand for shoes has so increased that there are relatively more men working in the shoe industry now than ever before. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the workmen in almost every trade have before them an object lesson of this kind, and yet, because they are ignorant of the history of their own trade even, they still firmly believe, as their fathers did before them, that it is against their best interests for each man to turn out each day as much work as possible. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>under this fallacious idea a large proportion of the workmen of both countries each day deliberately work slowly so as to curtail the output. almost every labor union has made, or is contemplating making, rules which have for their object curtailing the output of their members, and those men who have the greatest influence with the working-people, the labor leaders as well as many people with philanthropic feelings who are helping them, are daily spreading this fallacy and at the same time telling them that they are overworked. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""there is no question that the tendency of the average man (in all walks of life) is toward working at a slow, easy gait, and that it is only after a good deal of thought and observation on his part or as a result of example, conscience, or external pressure that he takes a more rapid pace. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""there are, of course, men of unusual energy, vitality, and ambition who naturally choose the fastest gait, who set up their own standards, and who work hard, even though it may be against their best interests. but these few uncommon men only serve by forming a contrast to emphasize the tendency of the average. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""this common tendency to 'take it easy' is greatly increased by bringing a number of men together on similar work and at a uniform standard rate of pay by the day. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""under this plan the better men gradually but surely slow down their gait to that of the poorest and least efficient. when a naturally energetic man works for a few days beside a lazy one, the logic of the situation is unanswerable. 'why should i work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that i do and does only half as much work?' </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>""a careful time study of men working under these conditions will disclose facts which are ludicrous as well as pitiable. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""to illustrate: the writer has timed a naturally energetic workman who, while going and coming from work, would walk at a speed of from three to four miles per hour, and not infrequently trot home after a day's work. on arriving at his work he would immediately slow down to a speed of about one mile an hour. when, for example, wheeling a loaded wheelbarrow, he would go at a good fast pace even uphill in order to be as short a time as possible under load, and immediately on the return walk slow down to a mile an hour, improving every opportunity for delay short of actually sitting down. in order to be sure not to do more than his lazy neighbor, he would actually tire himself in his effort to go slow. </p>",man,"['home', 'work', 'achievement']"
"<p>""these men were working under a foreman of good reputation and highly thought of by his employer, who, when his attention was called to this state of things, answered: 'well, i can keep them from sitting down, but the devil can't make them get a move on while they are at work.' </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""the writer was much interested recently in hearing one small but experienced golf caddy boy of twelve explaining to a green caddy, who had shown special energy and interest, the necessity of going slow and lagging behind his man when he came up to the ball, showing him that since they were paid by the hour, the faster they went the less money they got, and finally telling him that if he went too fast the other boys would give him a licking. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""the greater part of the systematic soldiering, however, is done by the men with the deliberate object of keeping their employers ignorant of how fast work can be done. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""so universal is soldiering for this purpose that hardly a competent workman can be found in a large establishment, whether he works by the day or on piece work, contract work, or under any of the ordinary systems, who does not devote a considerable part of his time to studying just how slow he can work and still convinc6 his employer that he is going at a good pace. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""the causes for this are, briefly, that practically all employers determine upon a maximum sum which they feel it is right for each of their classes of employees to earn per day, whether their men work by the day or piece. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""each workman soon finds out about what this figure is for his particular case, and he also realizes that when his employer is convinced that a man is capable of doing more work than he has done, he will find sooner or later some way of compelling him to do it with little or no increase of pay. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""employers derive their knowledge of how much of a given class of work can be done in a day from either their own experience, which has frequently grown hazy with age, from casual and unsystematic observation of their men, or at best from records which are kept, showing the quickest time in which each job has been done. in many cases the employer will feel almost certain that a given job can be done faster than it has been, but he rarely cares to take the drastic measures necessary to force men to do it in the quickest time, unless he has an actual record proving conclusively how fast the work can be done. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""it evidently becomes for each man's interest, then, to see that no job is done faster than it has been in the past. the younger and less experienced men are taught this by their elders, and all possible persuasion and social pressure is brought to bear upon the greedy and selfish men to keep them from making new records which result in temporarily increasing their wages, while all those who come after them are made to work harder for the same old pay. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""under the best day work of the ordinary type, when accurate records are kept of the amount of work done by each man and of his efficiency, and when each man's wages are raised as he improves, and those who fail to rise to a certain standard are discharged and a fresh supply of carefully selected men are given work in their places, both the natural loafing and systematic soldiering can be largely broken up. this can only be done, however, when the men are thoroughly convinced that there is no intention of establishing piece work even in the remote future, and it is next to impossible to make men believe this when the work is of such a nature that they believe piece work to be practicable. in most cases their fear of making a record which will be used as a basis for piece work will cause them to soldier as much as they dare. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""it is, however, under piece work that the art of systematic soldiering is thoroughly developed; after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output, he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employer's side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering can prevent it. unfortunately for the character of the workman, soldiering involves a deliberate attempt to mislead and deceive his employer, and thus upright and straightforward workmen are compelled to become more or less hypocritical. the employer is soon looked upon as an antagonist, if not an enemy, and the mutual confidence which should exist between a leader and his men, the enthusiasm, the feeling that they are all working for the same end and will share in the results is entirely lacking. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>""the feeling of antagonism under the ordinary piece-work system becomes in many cases so marked on the part of the men that any proposition made by their employers, however reasonable, is looked upon with suspicion, and soldiering becomes such a fixed habit that men will frequently take pains to restrict the product of machines which they are running when even a large increase in output would involve no more work on their part."" </p>",man,['work']
"<i><p>third</i>. as to the third cause for slow work, considerable space will later in this paper be devoted to illustrating the great gain, both to employers and employees, which results from the substitution of scientific for rule-of-thumb methods in even the smallest details of the work of every trade. the enormous saving of time and therefore increase in the output which it is possible to effect through eliminating unnecessary motions and substituting fast for slow and inefficient motions for the men working in any of our trades can be fully realized only after one has personally seen the improvement which results from a thorough motion and time study, made by a competent man. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>this paper will show that the underlying philosophy of all of the old systems of management in common use makes it imperative that each workman shall be left with the final responsibility for doing his job practically as he thinks best, with comparatively little help and advice from the management. and it will also show that because of this isolation of workmen, it is in most cases impossible for the men working under these systems to do their work in accordance with the rules and laws of a science or art, even where one exists. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer asserts as a general principle (and he proposes to give illustrations tending to prove the fact later in this paper) that in almost all of the mechanic arts the science which underlies each act of each workman is so great and amounts to so much that the workman who is best suited to actually doing the work is incapable of fully understanding this science, without the guidance and help of those who are working with him or over him, either through lack of education or through insufficient mental capacity. in order that the work may be done in accordance with scientific laws, it is necessary that there shall be a far more equal division of the responsibility between the management and the workmen than exists under any of the ordinary types of management. those in the management whose duty it is to develop this science should also guide and help the workman in working under it, and should assume a much larger share of the responsibility for results than under usual conditions is assumed by the management. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the body of this paper will make it clear that, to work according to scientific laws, the management must take over and perform much of the work which is now left to the men; almost every act of the workman should be preceded by one or more preparatory acts of the management which enable him to do his work better and quicker than he otherwise could. and each man should daily be taught by and receive the most friendly help from those who are over him, instead of being, at the one extreme, driven or coerced by his bosses, and at the other left to his own unaided devices. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>it will be shown by a series of practical illustrations that, through this friendly cooperation, namely, through sharing equally in every day's burden, all of the great obstacles (above described) to obtaining the maximum output for each man and each machine in the establishment are swept away. the 30 per cent to 100 per cent increase in wages which the workmen are able to earn beyond what they receive under the old type of management, coupled with the daily intimate shoulder to shoulder contact with the management, entirely removes all cause for soldiering. and in a few years, under this system, the workmen have before them the object lesson of seeing that a great increase in the output per man results in giving employment to more men, instead of throwing men out of work, thus completely eradicating the fallacy that a larger output for each man will throw other men out of work. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>it is the writer's judgment, then, that while much can be done and should be done by writing and talking toward educating not only workmen, but all classes in the community, as to the importance of obtaining the maximum output of each man and each machine, it is only through the adoption of modern scientific management that this great problem can be finally solved. probably most of the readers of this paper will say that all of this is mere theory. on the contrary, the theory, or philosophy, of scientific management is just beginning to be understood, whereas the management itself has been a gradual evolution, extending over a period of nearly thirty years. and during this time the employees of one company after another, including a large range and diversity of industries, have gradually changed from the ordinary to the scientific type of management. at least 50,000 workmen in the united states are now employed under this system; and they are receiving from 30 per cent to 100 per cent higher wages daily than are paid to men of similar caliber with whom they are surrounded, while the companies employing them are more prosperous than ever before. in these companies the output, per man and per machine, has on an average been doubled. during all these years there has never been a single strike among the men working under this system. in place of the suspicious watchfulness and the more or less open warfare which characterizes the ordinary types of management, there is universally friendly cooperation between the management and the men. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>it is not here claimed that any single panacea exists for all of the troubles of the working-people or of employers. as long as some people are born lazy or inefficient, and others are born greedy and brutal, as long as vice and crime are with us, just so long will a certain amount of poverty, misery, and unhappiness be with us also. no system of management, no single expedient within the control of any man or any set of men can insure continuous prosperity to either workmen or employers. prosperity depends upon so many factors entirely beyond the control of any one set of men, any state, or even any one country, that certain periods will inevitably come when both sides must suffer, more or less. it is claimed, however, that under scientific management the intermediate periods will be far more prosperous, far happier, and more free from discord and dissension. and also, that the periods will be fewer, shorter and the suffering less. and this will be particularly true in any one town, any one section of the country, or any one state which first substitutes the principles of scientific management for the rule of thumb. </p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>in an industrial establishment which employs say from 500 to 1000 workmen, there will be found in many cases at least twenty to thirty different trades. the workmen in each of these trades have had their knowledge handed down to them by word of mouth, through the many years in which their trade has been developed from the primitive condition, in which our far-distant ancestors each one practised the rudiments of many different trades, to the present state of great and growing subdivision of labor, in which each man specializes upon some comparatively small class of work. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the ingenuity of each generation has developed quicker and better methods for doing every element of the work in every trade. thus the methods which are now in use may in a broad sense be said to be an evolution representing the survival of the fittest and best of the ideas which have been developed since the starting of each trade. however, while this is true in a broad sense, only those who are intimately acquainted with each of these trades are fully aware of the fact that in hardly any element of any trade is their uniformity in the methods which are used. instead of having only one way which is generally accepted as a standard, there are in daily use, say, fifty or a hundred different ways of doing each element of the work. and a little thought will make it clear that this must inevitably be the case, since our methods have been handed down from man to man by word of mouth, or have, in most cases, been almost unconsciously learned through personal observation. practically in no instances have they been codified or systematically analyzed or described. the ingenuity and experience of each generation of each decade, even, have without doubt handed over better methods to the next. this mass of rule-of-thumb or traditional knowledge may be said to be the principal asset or possession of every tradesman. now, in the best of the ordinary types of management, the managers recognize frankly the fact that the 500 or 1000 workmen, included in the twenty to thirty trades, who are under them, possess this mass of traditional knowledge, a large part of which is not in the possession of the management. the management, of course, includes foremen and superintendents, who themselves have been in most cases first-class workers at their trades. and yet these foremen and superintendents know, better than any one else, that their own knowledge and personal skill falls far short of the combined knowledge and dexterity of all the workmen under them. the most experienced managers therefore frankly place before their workmen the problem of doing the work in the best and most economical way. they recognize the task before them as that of inducing each workman to use his best endeavors, his hardest work, all his traditional knowledge, his skill, his ingenuity, and his good-will in a word, his ""initiative,"" so as to yield the largest possible return to his employer. the problem before the management, then, may be briefly said to be that of obtaining the best initiative of every workman. and the writer uses the word ""initiative"" in its broadest sense, to cover all of the good qualities sought for from the men. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>on the other hand, no intelligent manager would hope to obtain in any full measure the initiative of his workmen unless he felt that he was giving them something more than they usually receive from their employers. only those among the readers of this paper who have been managers or who have worked themselves at a trade realize how far the average workman falls short of giving his employer his full initiative. it is well within the mark to state that in nineteen out of twenty industrial establishments the workmen believe it to be directly against their interests to give their employers their best initiative, and that instead of working hard to do the largest possible amount of work and the best quality of work for their employers, they deliberately work as slowly as they dare while they at the same time try to make those over them believe that they are working fast.(1*) </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the writer repeats, therefore, that in order to have any hope of obtaining the initiative of his workmen the manager must give some special incentive to his men beyond that which is given to the average of the trade. this incentive can be given in several different ways, as, for example, the hope of rapid promotion or advancement; higher wages, either in the form of generous piecework prices or of a premium or bonus of some kind for good and rapid work; shorter hours of labor; better surroundings and working conditions than are ordinarily given, etc., and, above all, this special incentive should be accompanied by that personal consideration for, and friendly contact with, his workmen which comes only from a genuine and kindly interest in the welfare of those under him. it is only by giving a special inducement or ""incentive"" of this kind that the employer can hope even approximately to get the ""initiative"" of his workmen. under the ordinary type of management the necessity for offering the workman a special inducement has come to be so generally recognized that a large proportion of those most interested in the subject look upon the adoption of some one of the modern schemes for paying men (such as piece work, the premium plan, or the bonus plan, for instance) as practically the whole system of management. under scientific management, however, the particular pay system which is adopted is merely one of the subordinate elements. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the writer hopes that the management of ""initiative and incentive"" will be recognized as representing the best type in ordinary use, and in fact he believes that it will be hard to persuade the average manager that anything better exists in the whole field than this type. the task which the writer has before him, then, is the difficult one of trying to prove in a thoroughly convincing way that there is another type of management which is not only better but overwhelmingly better than the management of ""initiative and incentive."" </p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>the universal prejudice in favor of the management of ""initiative and incentive"" is so strong that no mere theoretical advantages which can be pointed out will be likely to convince the average manager that any other system is better. it will be upon a series of practical illustrations of the actual working of the two systems that the writer will depend in his efforts to prove that scientific management is so greatly superior to other types. certain elementary principles, a certain philosophy, will however be recognized as the essence of that which is being illustrated in all of the practical examples which will be given. and the broad principles in which the scientific system differs from the ordinary or ""rule-of-thumb"" system are so simple in their nature that it seems desirable to describe them before starting with the illustrations. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<i><p>second</i>. they scientifically select and then train, teach, and develop the workman, whereas in the past he chose his own work and trained himself as best he could. </p>",man,['work']
<i><p>third</i>. they heartily cooperate with the men so as to insure all of the work being done in accordance with the principles of the science which has been developed. </p>,man,['work']
"<p>the fourth of these elements, ""an almost equal division of the responsibility between the management and the workmen,"" requires further explanation. the philosophy of the management of ""initiative and incentive"" makes it necessary for each workman to bear almost the entire responsibility for the general plan as well as for each detail of his work, and in many cases for his implements as well. in addition to this he must do all of the actual physical labor. the development of a science, on the other hand, involves the establishment of many rules, laws, and formul&aelig; which replace the judgment of the individual workman and which can be effectively used only after having been systematically recorded, indexed, etc. the practical use of scientific data also calls for a room in which to keep the books, records,(2*) etc., and a desk for the planner to work at. thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the workman, as a result of his personal experience, must of necessity under the new system be done by the management in accordance with the laws of the science; because even if the workman was well suited to the development and use of scientific data, it would be physically impossible for him to work at his machine and at a desk at the same time. it is also clear that in most cases one type of man is needed to plan ahead and an entirely different type to execute the work. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the man in the planning room, whose specialty under scientific management is planning ahead, invariably finds that the work can be done better and more economically by a subdivision of the labor; each act of each mechanic, for example, should be preceded by various preparatory acts done by other men. and all of this involves, as we have said, ""an almost equal division of the responsibility and the work between the management and the workman."" </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>perhaps the most prominent single element in modern scientific management is the task idea. the work of every workman is fully planned out by the management at least one day in advance, and each man receives in most cases complete written instructions, describing in detail the task which he is to accomplish, as well as the means to be used in doing the work. and the work planned in advance in this way constitutes a task which is to be solved, as explained above, not by the workman alone, but in almost all cases by the joint effort of the workman and the management. this task specifies not only what is to be done but how it is to be done and the exact time allowed for doing it. and whenever the workman succeeds in doing his task right, and within the time limit specified, he receives an addition of from 30 per cent to 100 per cent to his ordinary wages. these tasks are carefully planned, so that both good and careful work are called for in their performance, but it should be distinctly understood that in no case is the workman called upon to work at a pace which would be injurious to his health. the task is always so regulated that the man who is well suited to his job will thrive while working at this rate during a long term of years and grow happier and more prosperous, instead of being overworked. scientific management consists very largely in preparing for and carrying out these tasks. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the first illustration is that of handling pig iron, and this work is chosen because it is typical of perhaps the crudest and most elementary form of labor which is performed by man. this work is done by men with no other implements than their hands. the pig-iron handler stoops down, picks up a pig weighing about 92 pounds, walks for a few feet or yards and then drops it on to the ground or upon a pile. this work is so crude and elementary in its nature that the writer firmly believes that it would be possible to train an intelligent gorilla so as to become a more efficient pig-iron handler than any man can be. yet it will be shown that the science of handling pig iron is so great and amounts to so much that it is impossible for the man who is best suited to this type of work to understand the principles of this science, or even to work in accordance with these principles without the aid of a man better educated than he is. and the further illustrations to be given will make it clear that in almost all of the mechanic arts the science which underlies each workman's act is so great and amounts to so much that the workman who is best suited actually to do the work is incapable (either through lack of education or through insufficient mental capacity) of understanding this science. this is announced as a general principle, the truth of which will become apparent as one illustration after another is given. after showing these four elements in the handling of pig iron, several illustrations will be given of their application to different kinds of work in the field of the mechanic arts, at intervals in a rising scale, beginning with the simplest and ending with the more intricate forms of labor. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>we found that this gang were loading on the average about 12 1/2 long tons per man per day. we were surprised to find, after studying the matter, that a first-class pig-iron handler ought to handle between 47(3*) and 48 long tons per day, instead of 12 1/2 tons. this task seemed to us so very large that we were obliged to go over our work several times before we were absolutely sure that we were right. once we were sure, however, that 47 tons was a proper day's work for a first-class pig-iron handler, the task which faced us as managers under the modern scientific plan was clearly before us. it was our duty to see that the 80,000 tons of pig iron was loaded on to the cars at the rate of 47 tons per man per day, in place of 12 1/2 tons, at which rate the work was then being done. and it was further our duty to see that this work was done without bringing on a strike among the men, without any quarrel with the men, and to see that the men were happier and better contented when loading at the new rate of 47 tons than they were when loading at the old rate of 12 1/2 tons. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>we looked up their history as far back as practicable and thorough inquiries were made as to the character, habits, and the ambition of each of them. finally we selected one from among the four as the most likely man to start with. he was a little pennsylvania dutchman who had been observed to trot back home for a mile or so after his work in the evening about as fresh as he was when he came trotting down to work in the morning. we found that upon wages of $1.15 a day he had succeeded in buying a small plot of ground, and that he was engaged in putting up the walls of a little house for himself in the morning before starting to work and at night after leaving. he also had the reputation of being exceedingly ""close,"" that is, of placing a very high value on a dollar. as one man whom we talked to about him said, ""a penny looks about the size of a cart-wheel to him."" this man we will call schmidt. the task before us, then, narrowed itself down to getting schmidt to handle 47 tons of pig iron per day and making him glad to do it. this was done as follows. schmidt was called out from among the gang of pig-iron handlers and talked to somewhat in this way: </p>",man,"['home', 'work', 'achievement']"
"<p>""well, if you are a high-priced man, you will do exactly as this man tells you to-morrow, from morning till night. when he tells you to pick up a pig and walk, you pick it up and you walk, and when he tells you to sit down and rest, you sit down. you do that right straight through the day. and what's more, no back talk. now a high-priced man does just what he's told to do, and no back talk. do you understand that? when this man tells you to walk, you walk; when he tells you to sit down, you sit down, and you don't talk back at him. now you come on to work here to-morrow morning and i'll know before night whether you are really a high-priced man or not."" </p>",man,['work']
"<p>this seems to be rather rough talk. and indeed it would be if applied to an educated mechanic, or even an intelligent laborer. with a man of the mentally sluggish type of schmidt it is appropriate and not unkind, since it is effective in fixing his attention on the high wages which he wants and away from what, if it were called to his attention, he probably would consider impossibly hard work. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>schmidt started to work, and all day long, and at regular intervals, was told by the man who stood over him with a watch, ""now pick up a pig and walk. now sit down and rest. now walk -- now rest,"" etc. he worked when he was told to work, and rested when he was told to rest, and at half-past five in the afternoon had his 47 1/2 tons loaded on the car. and he practically never failed to work at this pace and do the task that was set him during the three years that the writer was at bethlehem. and throughout this time he averaged a little more than $1.85 per day, whereas before he had never received over $1.15 per day, which was the ruling rate of wages at that time in bethlehem. that is, he received 60 per cent higher wages than were paid to other men who were not working on task work. one man after another was picked out and trained to handle pig iron at the rate of 47 1/2 tons per day until all of the pig iron was handled at this rate, and the men were receiving 60 per cent more wages than other workmen around them. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer has given above a brief description of three of the four elements which constitute the essence of scientific management: first, the careful selection of the workman, and, second and third, the method of first inducing and then training and helping the workman to work according to the scientific method. nothing has as yet been said about the science of handling pig iron. the writer trusts, however, that before leaving this illustration the reader will be thoroughlyconvinced that there is a science of handling pig iron, and further that this science amounts to so much that the man who is suited to handle pig iron cannot possibly understand it, nor even work in accordance with the laws of this science, without the help of those who are over him. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer came into the machine-shop of the midvale steel company in 1878, after having served an apprenticeship as a pattern-maker and as a machinist. this was close to the end of the long period of depression following the panic of 1873, and business was so poor that it was impossible for many mechanics to get work at their trades. for this reason he was obliged to start as a day laborer instead of working as a mechanic. fortunately for him, soon after he came into the shop the clerk of the shop was found stealing. there was no one else available, and so, having more education than the other laborers (since he had been prepared for college) he was given the position of clerk. shortly after this he was given work as a machinist in running one of the lathes, and, as he turned out rather more work than other machinists were doing on similar lathes, after several months was made gangboss over the lathes. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>almost all of the work of this shop had been done on piece work for several years. as was usual then, and in fact as is still usual in most of the shops in this country, the shop was really run by the workmen, and not by the bosses. the workmen together had carefully planned just how fast each job should be done, and they had set a pace for each machine throughout the shop, which was limited to about one-third of a good day's work. every new workman who came into the shop was told at once by the other men exactly how much of each kind of work he was to do, and unless he obeyed these instructions he was sure before long to be driven out of the place by the men. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the writer told them plainly that he was now working on the side of the management, and that he proposed to do whatever he could to get a fair day's work out of the lathes. this immediately started a war; in most cases a friendly war, because the men who were under him were his personal friends, but none the less a war, which as time went on grew more and more bitter. the writer used every expedient to make them do a fair day's work, such as discharging or lowering the wages of the more stubborn men who refused to make any improvement, and such as lowering the piece-work price, hiring green men, and personally teaching them how to do the work, with the promise from them that when they had learned how, they would then do a fair day's work. while the men constantly brought such pressure to bear (both inside and outside the works) upon all those who started to increase their output that they were finally compelled to do about as the rest did, or else quit. no one who has not had this experience can have an idea of the bitterness which is gradually developed in such a struggle. in a war of this kind the workmen have one expedient which is usually effective. they use their ingenuity to contrive various ways in which the machines which they are running are broken or damaged -- apparently by accident, or in the regular course of work -- and this they always lay at the door of the foreman, who has forced them to drive the machine so hard that it is overstrained and is being ruined. and there are few foremen indeed who are able to stand up against the combined pressure of all of the men in the shop. in this case the problem was complicated by the fact that the shop ran both day and night. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer had two advantages, however, which are not possessed by the ordinary foreman, and these came, curiously enough, from the fact that he was not the son of a working man. </p>",man,['work']
"<i><p>first</i>, owing to the fact that he happened not to be of working parents, the owners of the company believed that he had the interest of the works more at heart than the other workmen, and they therefore had more confidence in his word than they did in that of the machinists who were under him. so that, when the machinists reported to the superintendent that the machines were being smashed up because an incompetent foreman was overstraining them, the superintendent accepted the word of the writer when he said that these men were deliberately breaking their machines as a part of the piece-work war which was going on, and he also allowed the writer to make the only effective answer to this vandalism on the part of the men, namely: ""there will be no more accidents to the machines in this shop. if any part of a machine is broken the man in charge of it must pay at least a part of the cost of its repair, and the fines collected in this way will all be handed over to the mutual beneficial association to help care for sick workmen."" this soon stopped the wilful breaking of machines. </p>",man,['work']
"<i><p>second</i>. if the writer had been one of the workmen, and had lived where they lived, they would have brought such social pressure to bear upon him that it would have been impossible to have stood out against them. he would have been called ""scab"" and other foul names every time he appeared on the street, his wife would have been abused, and his children would have been stoned. once or twice he was begged by some of his friends among the workmen not to walk home, about two and a half miles along the lonely path by the side of the railway. he was told that if he continued to do this it would be at the risk of his life. in all such cases, however, a display of timidity is apt to increase rather than diminish the risk, so the writer told these men to say to the other men in the shop that he proposed to walk home every night right up that railway track; that he never had carried and never would carry any weapon of any kind, and that they could shoot and be d -- -- -. </p>",man,['home']
"<p>after about three years of this kind of struggling, the output of the machines had been materially increased, in many cases doubled, and as a result the writer had been promoted from one gang-boss-ship to another until he became foreman of the shop. for any right-minded man, however, this success is in no sense a recompense for the bitter relations which he is forced to maintain with all of those around him. life which is one continuous struggle with other men is hardly worth living. his workman friends came to him continually and asked him, in a personal, friendly way, whether he would advise them, for their own best interest, to turn out more work. and, as a truthful man, he had to tell them that if he were in their place he would fight against turning out any more work, just as they were doing, because under the piecework system they would be allowed to earn no more wages than they had been earning, and yet they would be made to work harder. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>soon after being made foreman, therefore, he decided to make a determined effort to in some way change the system of management, so that the interests of the workmen and the management should become the same, instead of antagonistic. this resulted, some three years later, in the starting of the type of management which is described in papers presented to the american society of mechanical engineers entitled ""a piece-rate system"" and ""shop management."" </p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>in preparation for this system the writer realized that the greatest obstacle to harmonious cooperation between the workmen and the management lay in the ignorance of the management as to what really constitutes a proper day's work for a workman. he fully realized that, although he was foreman of the shop, the combined knowledge and skill of the workmen who were under him was certainly ten times as great as his own. he therefore obtained the permission of mr william sellers, who was at that time the president of the midvale steel company, to spend some money in a careful, scientific study of the time required to do various kinds of work. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>mr sellers allowed this more as a reward for having, to a certain extent, ""made good"" as foreman of the shop in getting more work out of the men, than for any other reason. he stated, however, that he did not believe that any scientific study of this sort would give results of much value. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>among several investigations which were undertaken at this time, one was an attempt to find some rule, or law, which would enable a foreman to know in advance how much of any kind of heavy laboring work a man who was well suited to his job ought to do in a day; that is, to study the tiring effect of heavy labor upon a first-class man. our first step was to employ a young college graduate to look up all that had been written on the subject in english, german, and french. two classes of experiments had been made: one by physiologists who were studying the endurance of the human animal, and the other by engineers who wished to determine what fraction of a horse-power a man-power was. these experiments had been made largely upon men who were lifting loads by means of turning the crank of a winch from which weights were suspended, and others who were engaged in walking, running, and lifting weights in various ways. however, the records of these investigations were so meager that no law of any value could be deduced from them. we therefore started a series of experiments of our own. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>two first-class laborers were selected, men who had proved themselves to be physically powerful and who were also good steady workers. these men were paid double wages during the experiments, and were told that they must work to the best of their ability at all times, and that we should make certain tests with them from time to time to find whether they were ""soldiering"" or not, and that the moment either one of them started to try to deceive us he would be discharged. they worked to the best of their ability throughout the time that they were being observed. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>now it must be clearly understood that in these experiments we were not trying to find the maximum work that a man could do on a short spurt or for a few days, but that our endeavor was to learn what really constituted a full day's work for a first-class man; the best day's work that a man could properly do, year in and year out, and still thrive under. these men were given all kinds of tasks, which were carried out each day under the close observation of the young college man who was conducting the experiments, and who at the same time noted with a stop-watch the proper time for all of the motions that were made by the men. every element in any way connected with the work which we believed could have a bearing on the result was carefully studied and recorded. what we hoped ultimately to determine was what fraction of a horse-power a man was able to exert, that is, how many foot-pounds of work a man could do in a day. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>after completing this series of experiments, therefore, each man's work for each day was translated into foot-pounds of energy, and to our surprise we found that there was no constant or uniform relation between the foot-pounds of energy which the man exerted during a day and the tiring effect of his work. on some kinds of work the man would be tired out when doing perhaps not more than one-eighth of a horse-power, while in others he would be tired to no greater extent by doing half a horse-power of work. we failed, therefore, to find any law which was an accurate guide to the maximum day's work for a first-class workman. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>a large amount of very valuable data had been obtained, which enabled us to know, for many kinds of labor, what was a proper day's work. it did not seem wise, however, at this time to spend any more money in trying to find the exact law which we were after. some years later, when more money was available for this purpose, a second series of experiments was made, similar to the first, but somewhat more thorough. this, however, resulted as the first experiments, in obtaining valuable information but not in the development of a law. again, some years later, a third series of experiments was made, and this time no trouble was spared in our endeavor to make the work thorough. every minute element which could in anyway affect the problem was carefully noted and studied, and two college men devoted about three months to the experiments. after this data was again translated into foot-pounds of energy exerted for each man each day, it became perfectly clear that there is no direct relation between the horse-power which a man exerts(that is, his foot-pounds of energy per day) and the tiring effect of the work on the man. the writer, however, was quite as firmly convinced as ever that some definite, clear-cut law existed as to what constitutes a full day's work for a first-class laborer, and our data had been so carefully collected and recorded that he felt sure that the necessary information was included somewhere in the records. the problem of developing this law from the accumulated facts was therefore handed over to mr carl g. barth, who is a better mathematician than any of the rest of us, and we decided to investigate the problem in a new way, by graphically representing each element of the work through plotting curves, which should give us, as it were, a bird's-eye view of every element. in a comparatively short time mr barth had discovered the law governing the tiring effect of heavy labor on a first-class man. and it is so simple in its nature that it is truly remarkable that it should not have been discovered and clearly understood years before. the law which was developed is as follows: </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the law is confined to that class of work in which the limit of a man's capacity is reached because he is tired out. it is the law of heavy laboring, corresponding to the work of the cart horse, rather than that of the trotter. practically all such work consists of a heavy pull or a push on the man's arms, that is, the man's strength is exerted by either lifting or pushing something which he grasps in his hands. and the law is that for each given pull or push on the man's arms it is possible for the workman to be under load for only a definite percentage of the day. for example, when pig iron is being handled (each pig weighing 92 pounds), a first-class workman can only be under load 43 per cent of the day. he must be entirely free from load during 57 per cent of the day. and as the load becomes lighter, the percentage of the day under which the man can remain under load increases. so that, if the workman is handling a half-pig, weighing 46 pounds, he can then be under load 58 per cent of the day, and only has to rest during 42 per cent. as the weight grows lighter the man can remain under load during a larger and larger percentage of the day, until finally a load is reached which he can carry in his hands all day long without being tired out. when that point has been arrived at this law ceases to be useful as a guide to a laborer's endurance, and some other law must be found which indicates the man's capacity for work. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>when a laborer is carrying a piece of pig iron weighing 92 pounds in his hands, it tires him about as much to stand still under the load as it does to walk with it, since his arm muscles are under the same severe tension whether he is moving or not. a man, however, who stands still under a load is exerting no horse-power whatever, and this accounts for the fact that no constant relation could be traced in various kinds of heavy laboring work between the foot-pounds of energy exerted and the tiring effect of the work on the man. it will also be clear that in all work of this kind it is necessary for the arms of the workman to be completely free from load (that is, for the workman to rest) at frequent intervals. throughout the time that the man is under a heavy load the tissues of his arm muscles are in process of degeneration, and frequent periods of rest are required in order that the blood may have a chance to restore these tissues to their normal condition. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>to return now to our pig-iron handlers at the bethlehem steel company. if schmidt had been allowed to attack the pile of 47 tons of pig iron without the guidance or direction of a man who understood the art, or science, of handling pig iron, in his desire to earn his high wages he would probably have tired himself out by 11 or 12 o'clock in the day. he would have kept so steadily at work that his muscles would not have had the proper periods of rest absolutely needed for recuperation, and he would have been completely exhausted early in the day. by having a man, however, who understood this law, stand over him and direct his work, day after day, until he acquired the habit of resting at proper intervals, he was able to work at an even gait all day long without unduly tiring himself. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>now one of the very first requirements for a man who is fit to handle pig iron as a regular occupation is that he shall be so stupid and so phlegmatic that he more nearly resembles in his mental make-up the ox than any other type. the man who is mentally alert and intelligent is for this very reason entirely unsuited to what would, for him, be the grinding monotony of work of this character. therefore the workman who is best suited to handling pig iron is unable to understand the real science of doing this class of work. he is so stupid that the word ""percentage"" has no meaning to him, and he must consequently be trained by a man more intelligent than himself into the habit of working in accordance with the laws of this science before he can be successful. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer trusts that it is now clear that even in the case of the most elementary form of labor that is known, there is a science, and that when the man bestsuited to this class of work has been carefully selected, when the science of doing the work has been developed, and when the carefully selected man has been trained to work in accordance with this science, the results obtained must of necessity be overwhelmingly greater than those which are possible under the plan of ""initiative and incentive."" </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the writer has put the problem before many good managers, and asked them whether, under premium work, piece work, or any of the ordinary plans of management, they would be likely even to approximate 47 tons(4*) per man per day, and not a man has suggested that an output of over 18 to 25 tons could be attained by any of the ordinary expedients. it will be remembered that the bethlehem men were loading only 12 1/2 tons per man. </p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>to go into the matter in more detail, however: as to the scientific selection of the men, it is a fact that in this gang of 75 pig-iron handlers only about one man in eight was physically capable of handling 47 1/2 tons per day. with the very best of intentions, the other seven out of eight men were physically unable to work at this pace. now the one man in eight who was able to do this work was in no sense superior to the other men who were working on the gang. he merely happened to be a man of the type of the ox, no rare specimen of humanity, difficult to find and therefore very highly prized. on the contrary, he was a man so stupid that he was unfitted to do most kinds of laboring work, even. the selection of the man, then, does not involve finding some extraordinary individual, but merely picking out from among very ordinary men the few who are especially suited to this type of work. although in this particular gang only one man in eight was suited to doing the work, we had not the slightest difficulty in getting all the men who were needed -- some of them from inside of the works and others from the neighboring country -- who were exactly suited to the job. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>under the management of ""initiative and incentive"" the attitude of the management is that of ""putting the work up to the workmen."" what likelihood would there be, then, under the old type of management, of these men properly selecting themselves for pig-iron handling? would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man? no! and no expedient could be devised which would make these men properly select themselves. even if they fully realized the necessity of doing so in order to obtain high wages (and they are not sufficiently intelligent properly to grasp this necessity), the fact that their friends or their brothers who were working right alongside of them would temporarily be thrown out of a job because they were not suited to this kind of work would entirely prevent them from properly selecting themselves, that is, from removing the seven out of eight men on the gang who were unsuited to pig-iron handling. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>as to the possibility, under the old type of management, of inducing these pig-iron handlers (after they had been properly selected) to work in accordance with the science of doing heavy laboring, namely, having proper scientifically determined periods of rest in close sequence to periods of work. as has been indicated before, the essential idea of the ordinary types of management is that each workman has become more skilled in his own trade than it is possible for any one in the management to be, and that, therefore, the details of how the work shall best be done must be left to him. the idea, then, of taking one man after another and training him under a competent teacher into new working habits until he continually and habitually works in accordance with scientific laws, which have been developed by some one else, is directly antagonistic to the old idea that each workman can best regulate his own way of doing the work. and besides this, the man suited to handling pig iron is too stupid properly to train himself. thus it will be seen that with the ordinary types of management the development of scientific knowledge to replace rule of thumb, the scientific selection of the men, and inducing the men to work in accordance with these scientific principles are entirely out of the question. and this because the philosophy of the old management puts the entire responsibility upon the workmen, while the philosophy of the new places a great part of it upon the management. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>with most readers great sympathy will be aroused because seven out of eight of these pig-iron handlers were thrown out of a job. this sympathy is entirely wasted, because almost all of them were immediately given other jobs with the bethlehem steel company. and indeed it should be understood that the removal of these men from pig-iron handling, for which they were unfit, was really a kindness to themselves, because it was the first step toward finding them work for which they were peculiarly fitted, and at which, after receiving proper training, they could permanently and legitimately earn higher wages. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>for example, the average man would question whether there is much of any science in the work of shoveling. yet there is but little doubt, if any intelligent reader of this paper were deliberately to set out to find what may be called the foundation of the science of shoveling, that with perhaps 15 to 20 hours of thought and analysis he would be almost sure to have arrived at the essence of this science. on the other hand, so completely are the rule-of-thumb ideas still dominant that the writer has never met a single shovel contractor to whom it had ever even occurred that there was such a thing as the science of shoveling. this science is so elementary as to be almost self-evident. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>for a first-class shoveler there is a given shovel load at which he will do his biggest day's work. what is this shovel load? will a first-class man do more work per day with a shovel load of 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20, 25, 30, or 40 pounds? now this is a question which can be answered only through carefully made experiments. by first selecting two or three first-class shovelers, and paying them extra wages for doing trustworthy work, and then gradually varying the shovel load and having all the conditions accompanying the work carefully observed for several weeks by men who were used to experimenting, it was found that a first-class man would do his biggest day's work with a shovel load of about 21 pounds. for instance, that this man would shovel a larger tonnage per day with a 21-pound load than with a 24-pound load or than with an 18-pound load on his shovel. it is, of course, evident that no shoveler can always take a load of exactly21 pounds on his shovel, but nevertheless, although his load may vary 3 or 4 pounds one way or the other, either below or above the 21 pounds1 he will do his biggest day's work when his average for the day is about 21 pounds. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer does not wish it to be understood that this is the whole of the art or science of shoveling. there are many other elements, which together go to make up this science. but he wishes to indicate the important effect which this one piece of scientific knowledge has upon the work of shoveling. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>at the works of the bethlehem steel company, for example, as a result of this law, instead of allowing each shoveler to select and own his own shovel, it became necessary to provide some 8 to 10 different kinds of shovels, etc., each one appropriate to handling a given type of material; not only so as to enable the men to handle an average load of 21 pounds, but also to adapt the shovel to several other requirements which become perfectly evident when this work is studied as a science. a large shovel tool room was built, in which were stored not only shovels but carefully designed and standardized labor implements of all kinds, such as picks, crowbars, etc. this made it possible to issue to each workman a shovel which would hold a load of 21 pounds of whatever class of material they were to handle: a small shovel for ore, say, or a large one for ashes. iron ore is one of the heavy materials which are handled in a works of this kind, and rice coal, owing to the fact that it is so slippery on the shovel, is one of the lightest materials. and it was found on studying the rule-of-thumb plan at the bethlehem steel company, where each shoveler owned his own shovel, that he would frequently go from shoveling ore, with a load of about 30 pounds per shovel, to handling rice coal, with a load on the same shovel of less than 4 pounds. in the one case, he was so overloaded that it was impossible for him to do a full day's work, and in the other case he was so ridiculously underloaded that it was manifestly impossible to even approximate a day's work. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>briefly to illustrate some of the other elements which go to make up the science of shoveling, thousands of stop-watch observations were made to study just how quickly a laborer, provided in each case with the proper type of shovel, can push his shovel into the pile of materials and then draw it out properly loaded. these observations were made first when pushing the shovel into the body of the pile. next when shoveling on a dirt bottom, that is, at the outside edge of the pile, and next with a wooden bottom, and finally with an iron bottom. again a similar accurate time study was made of the time required to swing the shovel backward and then throw the load for a given horizontal distance, accompanied by a given height. this time study was made for various combinations of distance and height. with data of this sort before him, coupled with the law of endurance described in the case of the pig-iron handlers, it is evident that the man who is directing shovelers can first teach them the exact methods which should be employed to use their strength to the very best advantage, and can then assign them daily tasks which are so just that the workman can each day be sure of earning the large bonus which is paid whenever he successfully performs this task. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>there were about 600 shovelers and laborers of this general class in the yard of the bethlehem steel company at this time. these men were scattered in their work over a yard which was, roughly, about two miles long and half a mile wide. in order that each workman should be given his proper implement and his proper instructions for doing each new job, it was necessary to establish a detailed system for directing men in their work, in place of the old plan of handling them in large groups, or gangs, under a few yard foremen. as each workman came into the works in the morning, he took out of his own special pigeonhole, with his number on the outside, two pieces of paper, one of which stated just what implements he was to get from the tool room and where he was to start to work, and the second of which gave the history of his previous day's work; that is, a statement of the work which he had done, how much he had earned the day before, etc. many of these men were foreigners and unable to read and write, but they all knew at a glance the essence of this report, because yellow paper showed the man that he had failed to do his full task the day before, and informed him that he had not earned as much as $1.85 a day, and that none but high-priced men would be allowed to stay permanently with this gang. the hope was further expressed that he would earn his full wages on the following day. so that whenever the men received white slips they knew that everything was all right, and whenever they received yellow slips they realized that they must do better or they would be shifted to some other class of work. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>dealing with every workman as a separate individual in this way involved the building of a labor office for the superintendent and clerks who were in charge of this section of the work. in this office every laborer's work was planned out well in advance, and the workmen were all moved from place to place by the clerks with elaborate diagrams or maps of the yard before them, very much as chessmen are moved on a chess-board, a telephone and messenger system having been installed for this purpose. in this way a large amount of the time lost through having too many men in one place and too few in another, and through waiting between jobs, was entirely eliminated. under the old system the workmen were kept day after day in comparatively large gangs, each under a single foreman, and the gang was apt to remain of pretty nearly the same size whether there was much or little of the particular kind of work on hand which this foreman had under his charge, since each gang had to be kept large enough to handle whatever work in its special line was likely to come along. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>when one ceases to deal with men in large gangs or groups, and proceeds to study each workman as an individual, if the workman fails to do his task, some competent teacher should be sent to show him exactly how his work can best be done, to guide, help, and encourage him, and, at the same time, to study his possibilities as a workman. so that, under the plan which individualizes each workman, instead of brutally discharging the man or lowering his wages for failing to make good at once, he is given the time and the help required to make him proficient at his present job, or he is shifted to another class of work for which he is either mentally or physically better suited. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>all of this requires the kindly cooperation of the management, and involves a much more elaborate organization and system than the old-fashioned herding of men in large gangs. this organization consisted, in this case, of one set of men, who were engaged in the development of the science of laboring through time study, such as has been described above; another set of men, mostly skilled laborers themselves, who were teachers, and who helped and guided the men in their work; another set of tool-room men who provided them with the proper implements and kept them in perfect order, and another set of clerks who planned the work well in advance, moved the men with the least loss of time from one place to another, and properly recorded each man's earnings, etc. and this furnishes an elementary illustration of what has been referred to as cooperation between the management and the workmen. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>perhaps the most important of all the results attained was the effect on the workmen themselves. a careful inquiry into the condition of these men developed the fact that out of the 140 workmen only two were said to be drinking men. this does not, of course, imply that many of them did not take an occasional drink. the fact is that a steady drinker would find it almost impossible to keep up with the pace which was set, so that they were practically all sober. many, if not most of them, were saving money, and they all lived better than they had before. these men constituted the finest body of picked laborers that the writer has ever seen together, and they looked upon the men who were over them, their bosses and their teachers, as their very best friends; not as nigger drivers, forcing them to work extra hard for ordinary wages, but as friends who were teaching them and helping them to earn much higher wages than they had ever earned before. it would have been absolutely impossible for any one to have stirred up strife between these men and their employers. and this presents a very simple though effective illustration of what is meant by the words ""prosperity for the employee, coupled with prosperity for the employer,"" the two principal objects of management. it is evident also that this result has been brought about by the application of the four fundamental principles of scientific management. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>as another illustration of the value of a scientific study of the motives which influence workmen in their daily work, the loss of ambition and initiative will be cited, which takes place in workmen when they are herded into gangs instead of being treated as separate individuals. a careful analysis had demonstrated the fact that when workmen are herded together in gangs, each man in the gang becomes far less efficient than when his personal ambition is stimulated; that when men work in gangs, their individual efficiency falls almost invariably down to or below the level of the worst man in the gang; and that they are all pulled down instead of being elevated by being herded together. for this reason a general order had been issued in the bethlehem steel works that not more than four men were to be allowed to work in a labor gang without a special permit, signed by the general superintendent of the works, this special permit to extend for one week only. it was arranged that as far as possible each laborer should be given a separate individual task. as there were about 5000 men at work in the establishment, the general superintendent had so much to do that there was but little time left for signing these special permits. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>after gang work had been by this means broken up, an unusually fine set of ore shovelers had been developed, through careful selection and individual, scientific training. each of these men was given a separate ear to unload each day, and his wages depended upon his own personal work. the man who unloaded the largest amount of ore was paid the highest wages, and an unusual opportunity came for demonstrating the importance of individualizing each workman. much of this ore came from the lake superior region, and the same ore was delivered both in pittsburg and in bethlehem in exactly similar cars. there was a shortage of ore handlers in pittsburg, and hearing of the fine gang of laborers that had been developed at bethlehem, one of the pittsburg steel works sent an agent to hire the bethlehem men. the pittsburg men offered 4 9/10 cents a ton for unloading exactly the same ore, with the same shovels, from the same cars, that were unloaded in bethlehem for 3 2/10 cents a ton. after carefully considering this situation, it was decided that it would be unwise to pay more than 3 2/10 cents per ton for unloading the bethlehem cars, because, at this rate, the bethlehem laborers were earning a little over $1.85 per man per day, and this price was 60 per cent more than the ruling rate of wages around bethlehem. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>a long series of experiments, coupled with close observation, had demonstrated the fact that when workmen of this caliber are given a carefully measured task, which calls for a big day's work on their part, and that when in return for this extra effort they are paid wages up to 60 per cent beyond the wages usually paid, that this increase in wages tends to make them not only more thrifty but better men in every way; that they live rather better, begin to save money, become more sober, and work more steadily. when, on the other hand, they receive much more than a 60 per cent increase in wages, many of them will work irregularly and tend to become more or less shiftless, extravagant, and dissipated. our experiments showed, in other words, that it does not do for most men to get rich too fast. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>after deciding, for this reason, not to raise the wages of our ore handlers, these men were brought into the office one at a time, and talked to somewhat as follows: </p>",man,['work']
"<p>""now, patrick, you have proved to us that you are a high-priced man. you have been earning every day a little more than $1.85, and you are just the sort of man that we want to have in our ore-shoveling gang. a man has come here from pittsburg, who is offering 4 9/10 cents per ton for handling ore while we can pay only 3 2/10 cents per ton. i think, therefore, that you had better apply to this man for a job. of course, you know we are very sorry to have you leave us, but you have proved yourself a high-priced man, and we are very glad to see you get this chance of earning more money. just remember, however, that at any time in the future, when you get out of a job, you can always come right back to us. there will always be a job for a high-priced man like you in our gang here."" </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>""well, sir, i'll tell you how it was. when we got out there jimmy and i were put on to a car with eight other men. we started to shovel the ore out just the same as we do here. after about half an hour i saw a little devil alongside of me doing pretty near nothing, so i said to him, 'why don't you go to work? unless we get the ore out of this car we won't get any money on pay-day.' he turned to me and said, 'who in -- -- -- are you?' 'well,' i said, 'that's none of your business'; and the little devil stood up to me and said, 'you'll be minding your own business, or i'll throw you off this car!' 'well, i could have spit on him and drowned him, but the rest of the men put down their shovels and looked as if they were going to back him up; so i went round to jimmy and said (so that the whole gang could hear it), 'now, jimmy, you and i will throw a shovelful whenever this little devil throws one, and not another shovelful.' so we watched him, and only shoveled when he shoveled. -- when pay-day came around, though, we had less money than we got here at bethlehem. after that jimmy and i went in to the boss, and asked him for a car to ourselves, the same as we got at bethlehem, but he told us to mind our own business. and when another pay-day came around we had less money than we got here at bethlehem, so jimmy and i got the gang together and brought them all back here to work again."" </p>",man,['work']
"<p>when working each man for himself, these men were able to earn higher wages at 3 2/10 cents a ton than they could earn when they were paid 4 9/10 cents a ton on gang work; and this again shows the great gain which results from working according to even the most elementary of scientific principles. but it also shows that in the application of the most elementary principles it is necessary for the management to do their share of the work in cooperating with the workmen. the pittsburg managers knew just how the results had been attained at bethlehem, but they were unwilling to go to the small trouble and expense required to plan ahead and assign a separate car to each shoveler, and then keep an individual record of each man's work, and pay him just what he had earned. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>he studied the best height for the mortar box and brick pile, and then designed a scaffold, with a table on it, upon which all of the materials are placed, so as to keep the bricks, the mortar, the man, and the wall in their proper relative positions. these scaffolds are adjusted, as the wall grows in height, for all of the bricklayers by a laborer especially detailed for this purpose, and by this means the bricklayer is saved the exertion of stooping down to the level of his feet for each brick and each trowelful of mortar and then straightening up again. think of the waste of effort that has gone on through all these years, with each bricklayer lowering his body, weighing, say, 150 pounds, down two feet and raising it up again every time a brick (weighing about 5 pounds) is laid in the wall! and this each bricklayer did about one thousand times a day. </p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>for example, mr gilbreth teaches his bricklayer to pick up a brick in the left hand at the same instant that he takes a trowelful of mortar with the right hand. this work with two hands at the same time is, of course, made possible by substituting a deep mortar box for the old mortar board (on which the mortar spread out so thin that a step or two had to be taken to reach it) and then placing the mortar box and the brick pile close together, and at the proper height on his new scaffold. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>most practical men would (knowing the opposition of almost all tradesmen to making any change in their methods and habits), however, be skeptical as to the possibility of actually achieving any large results from a study of this sort. mr gilbreth reports that a few months ago, in a large brick building which he erected, he demonstrated on a commercial scale the great gain which is possible from practically applying his scientific study. with union bricklayers, in laying a factory wall, twelve inches thick, with two kinds of brick, faced and ruled joints on both sides of the wall, he averaged, after his selected workmen had become skilful in his new methods, 350 bricks per man per hour; whereas the average speed of doing this work with the old methods was, in that section of the country, 120 bricks per man per hour. his bricklayers were taught his new method of bricklaying by their foreman. these who failed to profit by their teaching were dropped, and each man, as he became proficient under the new method, received a substantial (not a small) increase in his wages. with a view to individualizing his workmen and stimulating each man to do his best, mr gilbreth also developed an ingenious method for measuring and recording the number of bricks laid by each man, and for telling each workman at frequent intervals how many bricks he had succeeded in laying. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>it is only when this work is compared with the conditions which prevail under the tyranny of some of our misguided bricklayers' unions that the great waste of human effort which is going on will be realized. in one foreign city the bricklayers union have restricted their men to 275 bricks per day on work of this character when working for the city, and 375 per day when working for private owners. the members of this union are probably sincere in their belief that this restriction of output is a benefit to their trade. it should be plain to all men, however, that this deliberate loafing is almost criminal, in that it inevitably results in making every workman's family pay higher rent for their housing, and also in the end drives work and trade away from their city, instead of bringing it to it. </p>",man,"['home', 'work', 'achievement']"
"<p>it is highly likely that many times during all of these years individual bricklayers have recognized the possibility of eliminating each of these unnecessary motions. but even if, in the past, he did invent each one of mr gilbreth's improvements, no bricklayer could alone increase his speed through their adoption because it will be remembered that in all cases several bricklayers work together in a row and that the walls all around a building must grow at the same rate of speed. no one bricklayer, then, can work much faster than the one next to him. nor has any one workman the authority to make other men cooperate with him to do faster work. it is only through <i>enforced</i> standardization of methods, <i>enforced</i> adoption of the best implements and working conditions, and enforced cooperation that this faster work can be assured. and the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and of enforcing this cooperation rests with the <i>management</i> alone. the <i>management</i> must supply continually one or more teachers to show each new man the new and simpler motions, and the slower men must be constantly watched and helped until they have risen to their proper speed. all of those who, after proper teaching, either will not or cannot work in accordance with the new methods and at the higher speed must be discharged by the <i>management</i>. the <i>management</i> must also recognize the broad fact that workmen will not submit to this more rigid standardization and will not work extra hard, unless they receive extra pay for doing it. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the <i>management</i> must also see that those who prepare the bricks and the mortar and adjust the scaffold, etc., for the bricklayers, cooperate with them by doing their work just right and always on time; and they must also inform each bricklayer at frequent intervals as to the progress he is making, so that he may not unintentionally fall off in his pace. thus it will be seen that it is the assumption by the management of new duties and new kinds of work never done by employers in the past that makes this great improvement possible, and that, without this new help from the management, the workman even with full knowledge of the new methods and with the best of intentions could not attain these startling results. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>mr gilbreth's method of bricklaying furnishes a simple illustration of true and effective cooperation. not the type of cooperation in which a mass of workmen on one side together cooperate with the management; but that in which several men in the management (each one in his own particular way) help each workman individually, on the one hand, by studying his needs and his shortcomings and teaching him better and quicker methods, and, on the other hand, by seeing that all other workmen with whom he comes in contact help and cooperate with him by doing their part of the work right and fast. </p>",man,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>the writer has gone thus fully into mr gilbreth's method in order that it may be perfectly clear that this increase in output and that this harmony could not have been attained under the management of ""initiative and incentive"" (that is, by putting the problem up to the workman and leaving him to solve it alone) which has been the philosophy of the past. and that his success has been due to the use of the four elements which constitute the essence of scientific management. </p>",man,['achievement']
"<i><p>third</i>. bringing the first-class bricklayer and the science of bricklaying together, through the constant help and watchfulness of the management, and through paying each man a large daily bonus for working fast and doing what he is told to do. </p>",man,['work']
"<i><p>fourth</i>. an almost equal division of the work and responsibility between the workman and the management. all day long the management work almost side by side with the men, helping, encouraging, and smoothing the way for them, while in the past they stood one side, gave the men but little help, and threw on to them almost the entire responsibility as to methods, implements, speed, and harmonious cooperation. </p>",man,['work']
"<p>the writer was given the task of systematizing the largest bicycle ball factory in this country. this company had been running for from eight to ten years on ordinary day work before he undertook its reorganization, so that the one hundred and twenty or more girls who were inspecting the balls were ""old hands"" and skilled at their jobs. it is impossible even in the most elementary work to change rapidly from the old independence of individual day work to scientific cooperation. </p>",man,['work']
<p>in about two weeks the foreman reported that all of the girls he had talked to agreed that they could do their present work just as well in ten hours as in ten and one-half and that they approved of the change. </p>,man,['work']

"<p>may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. amy's dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed may's painted vases--that was one thorn. then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with may--that was thorn number two. but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs'. all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape. no hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, mrs. chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look...</p>",woman,['work']
"<p>""oh, certainly, if they are in your way,"" and sweeping her contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.</p>",woman,['work']
"<p>the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight, which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. but everything seemed against her. it was late, and she was tired. everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. the evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled. her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sephia tear on the cupid's cheek. she bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through her task.</p>",woman,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done right. beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and jo demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>""i ought, but i don't,"" thought amy, as her eye went from the bright page to may's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home. even a fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season. amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice. a group of girls were standing about may's table, admiring the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. they dropped their voices, but amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. it was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. she heard may say sorrowfully...</p>",woman,"['work', 'achievement']"
"<p>now, that was hard. when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its won reward. but it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. the bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for `the best nevvy in the world'.</p>",woman,"['work', 'achievement']"

"<p>""time will show. come away, impertinence, and don't shock my family by calling me names before their faces,"" answered amy, resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>""oh, dear!"" sighed amy, ""now she's in a contrary fit, and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready. i'm sure it's no pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's no one to pay it but you and me. i'll do anything for you, jo, if you'll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. you can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that i'm proud of you. i'm afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me.""</p>",woman,['work']
"<p>""you're a perfect cherub! now put on all your best things, and i'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good impression. i want people to like you, and they would if you'd only try to be a little more agreeable. do your hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet. it's becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit. take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief. we'll stop at meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one.""</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>amy looked relieved, but naughty jo took her at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. in vain mrs. chester alluded to her `charming novel', and the misses chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions. each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure ""yes"" or ""no"" with the chill on. in vain amy telegraphed the word `talk', tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. jo sat as if blandly unconcious of it all, with deportment like maud's face, `icily regular, splendidly null'.</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>mrs. kirke welcomed me so kindly i felt at home at once, even in that big house full of strangers. she gave me a funny little sky parlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny window, so i can sit here and write whenever i like. a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and i took a fancy to my den on the spot. the nursery, where i am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next mrs. kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, i fancy, but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs, and i've no doubt i shall make a model governess.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>as i went downstairs soon after, i saw something i liked. the flights are very long in this tall house, and as i stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, i saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, ""it goes better so. the little back is too young to haf such heaviness.""</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once i heard him say emphatically, ""no, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what i say,"" and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing exclamation, ""prut! it all goes bad this day.""</p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. the war is over, and mr. march safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind `brother', the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.</p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort, jo still found time for literary labors. the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end were not the best. she saw that money conferred power, therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved <i>more</i> than life.</p>",woman,['work']
"<p>the dream of filling home with comforts, giving beth everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years jo's most cherished castle in the air.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>she took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even all-perfect america read rubbish. she told no one, but concocted a `thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself to mr. dashwood, editor of the <i>weekly volcano</i>. she had never read <i>sartor resartus</i>, but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. so she dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance. somewhat daunted by this reception, jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much embarrassment...</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>whatever his motive might have been, laurie studied to some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the latin oration with the grace of a phillips and the eloquence of a demosthenes, so his friends said. they were all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--mr. and mrs. march, john and meg, jo and beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.</p>",man,['achievement']

"<p>while this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire. raphael's face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and bacchus on the head of a beer barrel. a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts to portray romeo and juliet supplied kindling for some time.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, and amy's hair, jo's nose, meg's mouth, and laurie's eyes were pronounced `wonderfully fine'. a return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads. children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused miss amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. her efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which quenched her ardor. other models failing her for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. with much difficulty and some danger she was dug out, for jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.</p>",woman,"['home', 'achievement']"
"<p>she was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she never became a great artist. here she succeeded better, for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star. everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. she had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, ""if amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do.""</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>""thanks, mother, you are always so kind."" and away went amy to lay her plan before her sisters. meg agreed at once, and promised to her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first.</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>the invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following monday was set apart for the grand event. hannah was out of humor because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that ""ef the washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well anywheres"". this hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but amy's motto was `<i>nil desperandum</i>', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. to begin with, hannah's cooking didn't turn out well. the chicken was tough, the tongue too salt, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly. then the cake and ice cost more than amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward. beth got a cold and took to her bed. meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.</p>",woman,"['home', 'work']"
"<p>the lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver would get safely home again. the carriages were promised, meg and mother were all ready to do the honors, beth was able to help hannah behind the scenes, jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights, for the `cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were her strong points.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. a smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>she did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve o'clock all was ready again. feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the `cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.</p>",woman,"['home', 'achievement']"
"<p>in came amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise. the rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and miss eliott found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them. the remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when `the party went out'.</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>a warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the whole family ate in heroic silence, till mr. march mildly observed, ""salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and evelyn..."" here a general explosion of laughter cut short the `history of salads', to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light. there was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. mr. laurence and aunt march shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three hebes carried around. no one said anything, till laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.</p>",man,['achievement']
"<p>the little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey meg had was the quiet walk with john from the old home to the new. when she came down, looking like a pretty quakeress in her dove-colored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say goodby, as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>when jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in beth. no one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on jo's heart as she saw her sister's face. it was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression lost much of its power, for beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares jo fora time forgot her fear.</p>",woman,['home']
"<p>one day beth told her. jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on beth's cheeks. but she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting. it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away form her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. for a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, ""jo, dear, i'm glad you know it. i've tried to tell you, but i couldn't.""</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>there was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even tears, for when most deeply moved, jo did not cry. she was the weaker then, land beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.</p>",woman,['achievement']
"<p>""it shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too young, beth. i can't let you go. i'll work and pray and fight against it. i'll keep you in spite of everything. there must be ways, it can't be too late. god won't be so cruel as to take you from me,"" cried poor jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than beth's.</p>",woman,['work']

"<p>while apparently absorbed in her own affairs, jo watched beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the rest. she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon, when she and beth were alone together. yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet. sitting at the window, beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal landscape. suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, ""all serene! coming in tonight.""</p>",woman,['work']

"<p>it was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example. but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then jo found her promise very hard to keep. how could she `comfort father and mother' when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister, how could she `make the house cheerful' when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new, and where in all the world could she `find some useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward? she tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along. some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow. it was not fair, for she tried more than amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble and hard work.</p>",woman,"['home', 'work', 'achievement']"
"<p>poor jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier.

"<p>captain arnault, commanding on the french side, sat alone in one of the cottages of the village, inhabited by the miller of the district.  the captain was reading, by the light of a solitary tallow-candle, some intercepted dispatches taken from the germans.  he had suffered the wood fire, scattered over the large open grate, to burn low; the red embers only faintly illuminated a part of the room.  on the floor behind him lay some of the miller's empty sacks.  in a corner opposite to him was the miller's solid walnut-wood bed.  on the walls all around him were the miller's colored prints, representing a happy mixture of devotional and domestic subjects.  a door of communication leading into the kitchen of the cottage had been torn from its hinges, and used to carry the men wounded in the skirmish from the field.  they were now comfortably laid at rest in the kitchen, under the care of the french surgeon and the english nurse attached to the ambulance.  a piece of coarse canvas screened the opening between the two rooms in place of the door.  a second door, <!-- p 193 -->leading from the bed-chamber into the yard, was locked; and the wooden shutter protecting the one window of the room was carefully barred.  sentinels, doubled in number, were placed at all the outposts.  the french commander had neglected no precaution which could reasonably insure for himself and for his men a quiet and comfortable night.",man,['home']

"<p>the maid had delivered her mistress's note to mercy, and had gone away again on her second errand to grace roseberry in her boudoir.  lady janet was seated at her writing-table, waiting for the appearance of the woman whom she had summoned to her presence.  a single lamp difused its mild light over the books, pictures, and busts round her, leaving the further end of the room, in which the bed was placed, almost lost in obscurity.  the works of art were all portraits; the books were all presentation copies from the authors.  it was lady janet's fancy to associate <!--476-->her bedroom with memorials of the various persons whom she had known in the long course of her life--all of them more or less distinguished, most of them, by this time, gathered with the dead.",woman,['work']

"<p>""she has a horror of referring to that part of her journey home,"" replied lady janet.  ""she mentioned her having been stopped on the frontier, and her finding herself accidentally in the company of another englishwoman, a perfect stranger to her.  i naturally asked questions on my side, and was shocked to hear that she had seen the woman killed by a german shell almost close at her side.  neither she nor i <!-- p 297 -->have had any relish for returning to the subject since.  you were quite right, julian, to avoid speaking of it while she was in the room.  i understand it all now.  grace, i suppose, mentioned my name to her fellow-traveler.  the woman is, no doubt, in want of assistance, and she applies to me through you.  i will help her; but she must not come here until i have prepared grace for seeing her again, a living woman.  for the present there is no reason why they should meet.""",woman,['work']

"<p>the effort was in vain.  those persons who study writing as an art are probably the only persons who can measure the vast distance which separates a conception as it exists in the mind from the reduction of that conception to form and shape in words.  the heavy stress of agitation that had been laid on mercy for hours together had utterly unfitted her for the delicate and difficult process of arranging the events of a narrative in their due sequence and their due proportion toward each other.  again and again she tried to begin her letter, and again and again she was baffled by the same hopeless confusion of ideas.  she gave up the struggle in despair.",woman,['achievement']
"<p>there was no time to forward her letter in the ordinary manner by post.  it must be taken to its destination by a private messenger.  lady janet's servants had hitherto been, one and all, at her disposal.  could she presume to employ them on her own affairs, when she might be dismissed from the house, a disgraced woman, in half an hour's time?  of the two alternatives it seemed better to take her chance, and present herself at the refuge without asking leave first.",woman,['achievement']

"<p>she had, as she well remembered, attended at a certain assembly (convened by a charitable society) in the character of lady janet's representative, at lady janet's own request.  for that reason she had been absent from the house when grace had entered it.  if her return had been delayed by a few minutes only, julian would have had time to take grace out of the room, and the terrible meeting which had stretched mercy senseless on the floor would never have taken place.  as the event had  happened, the period of her absence had been fatally shortened by what appeared at the time <!--452-->to be, the commonest possible occurrence.  the, persons assembled at the society's rooms had disagreed so seriously on the business which had brought them together as to render it necessary to take the ordinary course of adjourning the proceedings to a future day.  and chance, or fate, had so timed that adjournment as to bring mercy back into the dining-room exactly at the moment when grace roseberry insisted on being confronted with the woman who had taken her place.",woman,['work']

"<p>the same quick perception of dangers to be <!--383-->avoided and difficulties to be overcome which had warned her to leave the extravagant part of her character costume in the box at birmingham now kept her mind fully alive to the vast difference between a disguise worn by gas-light for the amusement of an audience and a disguise assumed by daylight to deceive the searching eyes of two strangers.  the first article of dress which she put on was an old gown of her own (made of the material called ""alpaca""), of a dark-brown color, with a neat pattern of little star-shaped spots in white.  a double flounce running round the bottom of this dress was the only milliner's ornament which it presented--an ornament not at all out of character with the costume appropriated to an elderly lady.  the disguise of her head and face was the next object of her attention.  she fitted and arranged the gray wig with the dexterity which constant practice had given her; fixed the false eyebrows (made rather large, and of hair darker than the wig) carefully in their position with the gum she had with her for the purpose, and stained her face with the customary stage materials, so as to change the transparent fairness of her complexion to the dull, faintly opaque color of a woman in ill health.  the lines and markings of age followed next; and here the first obstacles presented themselves.  the art which succeeded by gas-light failed by day: the difficulty of hiding the plainly artificial nature of the marks was almost insuperable.  she turned to her trunk; took from it two veils; and putting on her old-<!--384-->fashioned bonnet, tried the effect of them in succession.  one of the veils (of black lace) was too thick to be worn over the face at that summer season without exciting remark.  the other, of plain net, allowed her features to be seen through it, just indistinctly enough to permit the safe introduction of certain lines (many fewer than she was accustomed to use in performing the character) on the forehead and at the sides of the mouth.  but the obstacle thus set aside only opened the way to a new difficulty--the difficulty of keeping her veil down while she was speaking to other persons, without any obvious reason for doing so.  an instant's consideration, and a chance look at her little china palette of stage colors, suggested to her ready invention the production of a visible excuse for wearing her veil.  she deliberately disfigured herself by artificially reddening the insides of her eyelids so as to produce an appearance of inflammation which no human creature but a doctor--and that doctor at close quarters--could have detected as false.  she sprang to her feet and looked triumphantly at the hideous transformation of herself reflected in the glass.  who could think it strange now if she wore her veil down, and if she begged mrs. lecount's permission to sit with her back to the light?",woman,['achievement']
