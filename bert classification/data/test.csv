1894,"<p>the same quick perception of dangers to be <!--383-->avoided and difficulties to be overcome which had warned her to leave the extravagant part of her character costume in the box at birmingham now kept her mind fully alive to the vast difference between a disguise worn by gas-light for the amusement of an audience and a disguise assumed by daylight to deceive the searching eyes of two strangers.  the first article of dress which she put on was an old gown of her own (made of the material called ""alpaca""), of a dark-brown color, with a neat pattern of little star-shaped spots in white.  a double flounce running round the bottom of this dress was the only milliner's ornament which it presented--an ornament not at all out of character with the costume appropriated to an elderly lady.  the disguise of her head and face was the next object of her attention.  she fitted and arranged the gray wig with the dexterity which constant practice had given her; fixed the false eyebrows (made rather large, and of hair darker than the wig) carefully in their position with the gum she had with her for the purpose, and stained her face with the customary stage materials, so as to change the transparent fairness of her complexion to the dull, faintly opaque color of a woman in ill health.  the lines and markings of age followed next; and here the first obstacles presented themselves.  the art which succeeded by gas-light failed by day: the difficulty of hiding the plainly artificial nature of the marks was almost insuperable.  she turned to her trunk; took from it two veils; and putting on her old-<!--384-->fashioned bonnet, tried the effect of them in succession.  one of the veils (of black lace) was too thick to be worn over the face at that summer season without exciting remark.  the other, of plain net, allowed her features to be seen through it, just indistinctly enough to permit the safe introduction of certain lines (many fewer than she was accustomed to use in performing the character) on the forehead and at the sides of the mouth.  but the obstacle thus set aside only opened the way to a new difficulty--the difficulty of keeping her veil down while she was speaking to other persons, without any obvious reason for doing so.  an instant's consideration, and a chance look at her little china palette of stage colors, suggested to her ready invention the production of a visible excuse for wearing her veil.  she deliberately disfigured herself by artificially reddening the insides of her eyelids so as to produce an appearance of inflammation which no human creature but a doctor--and that doctor at close quarters--could have detected as false.  she sprang to her feet and looked triumphantly at the hideous transformation of herself reflected in the glass.  who could think it strange now if she wore her veil down, and if she begged mrs. lecount's permission to sit with her back to the light?",0,achievement
